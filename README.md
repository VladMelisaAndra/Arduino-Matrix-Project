# Arduino-Matrix-Project
This github repository contains the source code and documentation for an Arduino-based game.
  
### Backstory about the game
Growing up, I used to love playing a game called "Flying Witch" where you control a witch on a broomstick and try to avoid obstacles as you fly through the air. It was one of my favorite games and I always wanted to make something similar that would be just as challenging and fun. This Arduino game is my own version of the "Flying Witch" game.

### Game description
The Arduino game is a fast-paced, challenging game that utilizes an 8 x 8 LED matrix, an LCD screen, a joystick, and a buzzer. Upon powering up the game, players are greeted with a "Welcome" message before being taken to the Menu, which contains several options for customizing and playing the game. These options include difficulty, LCD and matrix brightness, and sound effects. The game also has an informative "How to Play" section, a “Highscore” section and a "About" section that provides details about the game's creator.

### Instruction on how to play
Once players choose to start the game, they must use the joystick to navigate their character through the matrix, avoiding walls that come at them from the top of the screen. As the player progresses through the levels, the game becomes more difficult, with walls coming faster and more frequently. The current level and score are displayed on the LCD screen, and a buzzer sounds to indicate when the player collides with a wall or advances to the next level.
Upon completing the game, players are congratulated on their performance and informed when they have beaten the high score and if so, given the option to enter their name.
